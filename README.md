Description

    This repo is a  portfolio of work that I have done while pursuing my Masters of Computer Science.
    It is not complete.
        - It excludes work (mostly small assignments) that was not under source control and is now difficult to retrieve.
        - It excludes work that I have done for employers, out of concern for intellectual property rights.
